<!--This is the XAML definition of the cutom tile used in the sample. The tile consists of a border containing some text and an image. 
     Note the the text values for TimeZone and Timestamp are not defined. These are added when the background task runs. The image source
     is also added when the background tast runs. 
     The border has the dimensions 360x360. This is because we are usign it to update the application tile, which has the dimensions of 150x150. 
     In order for the tile to look good on all resolutions, we are defining its size for the largest resolution scale of 240%, i.e. 240% of 150 is 360.
